# File-Parser
Program that will take any text file input and create three files which will contain the output from the file parser based on three criterions

1. First file, to be named “obsessive_non_ona.txt”, would contain all the words from input file which do not have characters “o”, “n” and “a” in them. The file must contain only distinct values in alphabetical order. 

2. Second file, to be named “popular_peeps.txt”, would contain all the words from the input file which occur most frequently (more than 3 times). This file must contain the words sorted alphabetically. 

3. Third file, to be named “non_alphanumerics.txt”, would contain all the non alphanumeric characters from the input file.
